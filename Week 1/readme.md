# Week 1 | Code + Words
Andy and Karen introduced us to CodeWords and a brief background on what projects they have been doing (So many cool ones!). We also got to discuss on the differences between how we read digitally and on paper. The things we read on a daily bases like how we get our information these days have changed dramatically. We found out that the majority reads any kind of information through social media, like Twitter and Instagram.

## Mini Melbourne
Due to this pandemic, we arent able to gather physically. However we discussed and explored how we could meet in a virtual city of Melbourne. As a whole class, we entered Mini Melbourne in Minecraft and were able to build, walk, fly, and talk to each other. It was a fun activity to do to start the semester.

The virtual worlds opended many different possibilites on how our class would explore Brief 2.

## p5.js
We then got to explore on creating our own initials by forming shapes or lines. This one I implemented the mouseX mouse Y function to change the background and the shape color.
