# Week 5 | Grab Your Popcorn
Exciting start of this weeks class because we got to share what we've been working on for Brief 2. It was very really amazing on what people have created in the span of 4 weeks, so many great ones! One that stuck to me was the Minecraft group with the scene of Jhonny laying down on the bed. I'm sure this horror story is planted in my head now :D Now that we've created these re-readings, I think that it elevated the story of House of Leaves.

## Brief 3
The second half of this weeks class was to discuss the objectives of brief 3, and the milestones we will use to help achieve our goals. We worked in small groups to make summmaries of any of the text provided. There was plenty to choose from and after we gathered everyone’s summaries I found them helpful in-order to decide my final choice.

My group chose to analyse ["Others Spaces"](http://digbeyond.com/readme/JPG/Foucault_1967_sm.pdf) by Michel Foucault.

We discussed and came to a conlusion on having this as a summary of the text:
The text discusses the definition of space, and how it’s been defined in multiple stances and contexts.

Questioning the boundaries of space, and the unlimitless ephemerality in instances such as utopia’s - and how we relate this to physical spaces that are akin (heterotopia’s). Inbetween the two lies a ‘mirror’.

Perception of space and it’s absence, using the analogy of mirror caused us to further contemplate the reality of this physical world we live in. Questioning if the mirror is portraying real life.

Public space, private space, social space, family space.
