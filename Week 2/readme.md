# Week 2
Our class started started with a short seminar on modular typeface designs, which ranged from the Bauhuas to contemporary designers working in algorithmic typography. Then it continued to our last group work this semester. ðŸ˜¢ 

## Typefaces
As I scroll down and search for modular typefaces, I came across this piece of work by MuirMcNeil. MuirMcNeil's particularly caught my eye with his 'Five' series of stencil type systems. The Five series was made in 2017 and it is constructed from basic geometric segments.

## Wholesome Animal Crossing
Was super excited to do this project with a group of great talented students, and especially because it was on Animal Crossing. We picked part 3 for our Re-readings on House of Leaves and we got the chance to explore possible ways to demonstrate our text. With the flexibility of changing costumes and appearance of characters, we were able to play dress up and imagine what each characters would look like. The juxtaposition of the cute like game and a horror text made our group more motivated and excited. It's one of those movies that you dont expect on happening.

## A Remix in p5.js
As a homework we had the chance to choose another students initials that they made in p5.js and change/add anything we would like. I got to do Jamie's letter 'e' and made his background color change according the position of the mouse. I was pretty nervous on doing this because I am not confident with my coding skills. However, as everyone else shared I felt more comfortable and found this collaboration work to be great.
