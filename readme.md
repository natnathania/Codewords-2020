## SKO Statement

Throughout this semester I aimed to broaden my skills in design through code. As a beginner creative coder, I step into the world of endless possibilities of results through generated algorithms and electronic literature. I aim to document all my learnings, inspiration, progress and reflection throughout the 12 Weeks of this studio CodeWords. Its been a long journey for me, especially because I was pretty nervous of where I would be diving into. Overall, its been a pleasure to learn from other students and also see each other grow.
