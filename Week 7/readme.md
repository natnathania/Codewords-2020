# Week 7 | Brief 3
This week we shared some of our paper-prototypes for our major project in small groups. We discussed how we can further develop our codes from these prototypes. I was in a group with Sam and Lauren and it was really interesting on how they perceive their text. It was an engaging discussion as we gave each other feedback and possible ways to create their idea come to life in p5.js.

I had a few ways to display my concept. The first one is having a line that acts as a mirror in the center of the canvas. As the user types any key, a phrase would appear on the right and left side of the canvas. One side being totally normal and the other side would be distorted. This concept of heterotpias is percieved by the reflection of the text through a mirror, which is a placeless place.

Display mirror.

IF no text on page
Press any key
ElSE no text is visible

WHILE keypressed
Text will appear on the left of the screen and a distorted reflection on the right side

My second one is again having the mirror in the middle where the user can interact by draging words from a word bank below. With the mouse they drag the text from left to right and see the text distort on live. When text go through the process of distortion, sound turns on.

Display split screen with a word bank

IF mouse drags text from left to right
THEN text would gradually distort
ELSE text will stay the same
